# SpellIT-Software

This is a work-in-progress. To run this project, you will need an API key from merriam webster dcitionary website (developer site). The Tk_dict_Button-sent.py file is the final working file for Spell it software. The file titled test.py is also working and it is a work-in-progress, since it displays the raw data from meriam webster upon clicking a word's tile.
